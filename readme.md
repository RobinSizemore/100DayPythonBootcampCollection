## 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp Repo

I got a little tired of creating a new repo for each "day" of the [100 days of code Python bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) that I'm taking at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

I'm going to use this as a collected repo instead going forward.

[Day 20: Snake Game (Part 1)](Day20-SnakeGamePt1)
- Create a snake body

- Control the snake

[Day 21: Snake Game (Part 2)](Day21-SnakeGamePt2)

- Create food

[Day 23: Turtle Crossing](Day23-TurtleCrossing)
