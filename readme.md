## 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp Repo

Now that we're not just using replit, I'm keeping a single repo for the [100 days of code Python bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) that I'm taking at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).  Note that "days" aren't really days - she has the course broken out that way, but I tend to do two or three per day as an experienced programmer just learning Python and making sure I have a grasp on the fundamentals of it.

Please note that there is a jump in the sequence of days. This is 
because a few "days" of the course were dedicated to HTML and CSS. 
As I frequently work with these technologies and feel comfortable 
with them, I decided to skip these lessons and did not feel the 
need for a refresher. Hence, the progression directly from the 
Day 39 to Day 45.

Please note that I've decided to skip Day 51 and Day 52 of the course. The projects for these days involved automating Twitter and Instagram respectively. I have no interest in using Twitter, especially considering their updated bot policies. As for Instagram, I do not approve of botting for followers, even as a practice exercise.
